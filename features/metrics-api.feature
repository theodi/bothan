Feature: Metrics API

  Background:
    Given I send and accept JSON
    And I set up a Pusher spy

  Scenario: GET list of all metrics
    Given there is a metric in the database with the name "membership-coverage"
    And there is a metric in the database with the name "membership-count"
    When I send a GET request to "metrics"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should have "$.metrics[0].name" with the text "membership-count"
    And the JSON response should have "$.metrics[0].url" with the text "http://example.org/metrics/membership-count.json"
    And the JSON response should have "$.metrics[1].name" with the text "membership-coverage"
    And the JSON response should have "$.metrics[1].url" with the text "http://example.org/metrics/membership-coverage.json"

  Scenario: POSTing structured data
    Given I authenticate as the user "foo" with the password "bar"
    When I send a POST request to "metrics/membership-coverage" with the following:
      """
      {
        "time": "2013-12-25T15:00:00+00:00",

      }

    Then the response status should be "201"
    And the Pusher endpoint should have recieved "membership-coverage" with "updated"
    And the data should be stored in the "membership-coverage" metric
    And the time of the stored metric should be "2013-12-25T15:00:00+00:00"
    And the value of the metric should be:
